# vehicles
## some work on autonoms agents mostly folowing nature of code style


Moving from simple particles being acted on by forces in the environment to autonomous agents reacting to their environment according to rules and steering forces. the vehicle class uses p5js vectors for position, velocity and acceleration. the built-in vector function .heading() makes it easy to rotate the vehicles. and vector math makes it easy to get the necessary force. I made a simple tadpole like vehicles with rect() and ellipse(). these just simply seek he screen touch. Following #Danielshiffman #natureofcode for implementing the code. also reading Valentino Braitenberg's book for a more philosophical discussion. #p5js #creativecoding
